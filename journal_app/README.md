# Journal - Python App

In this module I focused on imports, file loads/saves, handling switch cases (kind of), and abstraction layers. 

The seperation of journal.py and program.py was used to split the functionality of the overall program into 
user interation and handling the journal provide a more organized approach to this problem. This seperation made
development easier as I could focus on one task at a time. For example I could handle error from user input in
programs.py to ease the amount of edge cases that much be dealt with handling the journal functions. Going forward,
it would make sense to keep the journal module as a class, increasing the modularity of the code. 

The imports and loading and saving a file were basic steps but it was a good introduction to understanding os 
independicies and structuring a project. Going forward it will be easier to revisit handling image files for
the CROS-Sat implementation.
